# Introduction
This project was undertaken during my internship at DRDO and focuses on designing an AI-based Predictive Maintenance System for critical mechanical and electronic components. The primary goal is to prevent unexpected failures by using machine learning to detect early warning signs based on system health parameters like temperature, vibrations, and usage time.

This system simulates a real-time health monitoring pipeline that analyzes operational data and predicts whether a component is likely to fail, helping improve reliability and reduce maintenance costs in mission-critical environments.
